# L'haskeliota

These are the sources of the homework assignments I completed during the course on
`functional and imperative programming techniques`, or TPFI, taught by Professor Ivano Salvo
at Sapienza University of Rome, in the Faculty of Computer Science.\
The main goal of the course was to learn functional programming through the use of `Haskell`.\
Each folder contains the respective assigned homework.\
The course was conducted in Italian, so the material is also in Italian.
